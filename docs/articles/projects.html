        <hr>
        <br>
        <p>
            Hello! This is a list of some of my programming projects in roughly chronological order.
            This includes software, plugins, webpages, microcontroller projects, et cetera.
            Let me know if you have questions about anything and hope you enjoy!

        <h2 class="article-subsection">VEGAS Scripts/Plugins</h2>
        <img src="../images/projects/oscillator_randomizer_gui.png" class="article-image-intext" style="width: 40%;"
            alt="The GUI of my plugin VEGAS_Oscillator_Randomizer">
        <p>
            When I first started using MAGIX VEGAS Pro 18, I found it generally very advanced and feature
            rich, but at the same time lacking in certain effects that are standard in most editing software
            I've used. When I found out how easy it was to make plugins for VEGAS, I kind of got a little
            obsessed and
            made a whole bunch of 'em! This actually was my first time ever making plugins and
            while there is hardly any information or tutorials online on how to make VEGAS plugins, I must
            say the API and docs- er... <em>doc</em> is quite good. Mostly.
        </p>
        <p>
            This was also my first time working with C# outside of Unity and I quite like it. It also helps
            that it was really easy to pick up since its syntax is exceptionally similar to Java except for
            the Capitalization Of Everything. Working with Windows Forms was also very fun. There's
            something I can't really explain about the look of those default Windows dialog boxes that's
            somewhat nostalgic and just generally cool to work with; I get that same feeling with Java's
            Swing using the default look-and-feel. I don't know what it is. Maybe I'm just weird like that.
            I definitely envision myself using C# for something else in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
            I guess I should talk about the actual plugins, huh? Well there are a couple of really simple ones like one
            that selects everything after the playhead and one that adds a VEGAS Picture In Picture effect to everything
            (because yes, I wanted a script for that). The big and complex ones include a "screen shake" effect, a super
            janky "chromatic aberration" effect, and a plugin that can animate any parameter of a video effect based on
            an
            oscillator, random number generator, or noise.

        <h2>nitroguy10.github.io</h2>
        <p>Hey, its the website you're on right now! The way this site was created is actually pretty complicated and
            made for a good story so I wrote a whole other article about it. Check it out!</p>

        <h2>ERS-OL</h2>
        <img src="../images/projects/ers-ol.png" class="article-image-intext" style="width: 40%;"
            alt="Egyptian Rat Screw Online">
        <p>
            ERS-OL (Egyptian Rat Screw Online) is an online multiplayer web game version of my favorite card game,
            Egyptian Rat Screw. The game isn't actually being hosted anywhere right now so if you want to play it, you'd
            have to clone the repository and run the server yourself. It uses Python for the server and, unsurprisingly,
            JavaScript for the client.
        </p>
        <p>
            Just like my website, this is another project I'm suuuuuper proud of. I've never come close to doing a
            project involving networking at this scale or even at all. It took me an unprecidented amount of time and
            effort to complete it and I really am very happy with the final product... if it weren't for the ping.
        </p>
        <p>
            *sigh* yeah... in practice this game is rather unplayable over the internet because the ping gives the host
            a massive advantage. Actually, this game runs quite well if played over LAN, but if you're able to play this
            over LAN, THEN WHY NOT JUST PLAY THE ACTUAL CARD GAME AHAHHAHAHAH.
        </p>
        <p>
            Despite all that, I'm really happy I was able to finish this project. At the very least, it reassured me
            that game development is not the career path for me :P

        <h2>ColorSplitter</h2>
        <img src="../images/projects/colorsplitter.png" class="article-image-intext" style="width: 40%;"
            alt="The GUI of ColorSplitter">
        <p>
            ColorSplitter takes an input folder of images and isolates certain colors from that image (generating
            "whitemasks") and outputs them into a folder. I originally made it in Processing but then I realized I only
            used like 2 things from Processing so I remade it in pure Java. I'm not entirely sure what the applications
            for this are lol. I actually made this upon request from one of my friends. He needed a program that
            generated whitemasks for his game sprites or something so that program I did make.

        <h2>DocLCD</h2>
        <p>
            DocLCD is a "word processor" of sorts for 20x4 character LCDs with I2C drivers. It's controlled by a Python
            program running on a Raspberry Pi which talks via serial to an Arduino program. The Arduino program then
            controls the character LCD through the LCD's I2C driver. The Python program accepts keyboard input and
            allows you type characters and traverse around the LCD screen.

        <h2>TimeRefresher</h2>
        <img src="../images/projects/timerefresher.png" class="article-image-intext" style="width: 40%;"
            alt="The GUI of TimeRefresher">
        <p>
            I needed TimeRefresher for one very specific thing. "Press F5 at a certain time". Yep, that's it. I love
            just making programs to solve these tiny little inconveniences. Knowing how to code really <em>is</em> like
            having superpowers.

        <h2>RoundUp</h2>
        <img src="../images/projects/roundup_visual.png" class="article-image-intext" style="width: 40%;"
            alt="A visual of what RoundUp does">
        <p>
            RoundUp is a single Python script that copies all files from a directory tree into a single folder. The
            <a href="https://github.com/NitroGuy10/RoundUp#readme">README</a> does a better job of explaining
            this so check it out if you're interested. Just
            like with TimeRefresher, I created this to automate a process I often have had to do manually. Specifically,
            to deal with photos that were automatically organized into folders by programs against my will.

        <h2>tuscon</h2>
        <p>
            tuscon (yes, you read that right, that really is the name) is a super-simple web-templating library. All it is is HTML files with parameters, if statements, and
            for loops. I talk about my (unfortunate) reason for creating tuscon in that <a
                href="about_website.html">article about my website</a>.
