        <p>
            Hello! This is a list of some of my programming projects in roughly chronological order.
            This includes software, plugins, webpages, microcontroller projects, et cetera.
            Let me know if you have questions about anything and hope you enjoy!
        </p>

        <h2 class="article-subsection">VEGAS Scripts/Plugins</h2>
        <img src="../images/projects/oscillator_randomizer_gui.png" class="article-image-intext" style="width: 40%;"

        <p>
            When I first started using MAGIX VEGAS Pro 18, I found it generally very advanced and feature
            rich, but at the same time lacking in certain effects that are standard in most editing software
            I've used. When I found out how easy it was to make plugins for VEGAS, I kind of got a little
            obsessed and
            made a whole bunch of 'em! This actually was my first time ever making plugins and
            while there is hardly any information or tutorials online on how to make VEGAS plugins, I must
            say the API and docs- er... <em>doc</em> is quite good. Mostly.
        </p>
        <p>
            This was also my first time working with C# outside of Unity and I quite like it. It also helps
            that it was really easy to pick up since its syntax is exceptionally similar to Java except for
            the Capitalization Of Everything. Working with Windows Forms was also very fun. There's
            something I can't really explain about the look of those default Windows dialog boxes that's
            somewhat nostalgic and just generally cool to work with; I get that same feeling with Java's
            Swing using the default look-and-feel. I don't know what it is. Maybe I'm just weird like that.
            I definitely envision myself using C# for something else in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
            I guess I should talk about the actual plugins, huh? Well there are a couple of really simple ones like one
            that selects everything after the playhead and one that adds a VEGAS Picture In Picture effect to everything
            (because yes, I wanted a script for that). The big and complex ones include a "screen shake" effect, a super
            janky "chromatic aberration" effect, and a plugin that can animate any parameter of a video effect based on
            an
            oscillator, random number generator, or noise.

        <p>Hey, its the website you're on right now! The way this site was created is actually pretty complicated and
            made for a good story so I wrote a whole other article about it. Check it out!</p>

        <h2>ERS-OL</h2>

        <p>
            ERS-OL (Egyptian Rat Screw Online) is an online multiplayer web game version of my favorite card game,
            Egyptian Rat Screw. The game isn't actually being hosted anywhere right now so if you want to play it, you'd
            have to clone the repository and run the server yourself. It uses Python for the server and, unsurprisingly,
            JavaScript for the client.
        </p>
        <p>
            Just like my website, this is another project I'm suuuuuper proud of. I've never come close to doing a
            project involving networking at this scale or even at all. It took me an unprecidented amount of time and
            effort to complete it and I really am very happy with the final product... if it weren't for the ping.
        </p>
        <p>
            *sigh* yeah... in practice this game is rather unplayable over the internet because the ping gives the host
            a massive advantage. Actually, this game runs quite well if played over LAN, but if you're able to play this
            over LAN, THEN WHY NOT JUST PLAY THE ACTUAL CARD GAME AHAHHAHAHAH.
        </p>
        <p>
            Despite all that, I'm really happy I was able to finish this project. At the very least, it reassured me
            that game development is not the career path for me :P
        </p>
