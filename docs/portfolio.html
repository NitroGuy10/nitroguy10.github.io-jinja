            This is an abridged, more formal list of my personal projects including software, plugins, webpages,
            microcontroller projects, et cetera.
            If you would like some personal commentary about each project, visit my main <a
                href="./articles/projects.html">projects article</a>, though please note its tone is much more informal
            and conversational. Let me know if you have questions about anything.
        </p>
        <p>
            Most of these projects are on my <a href="https://github.com/NitroGuy10">GitHub</a>.

            on the frontend and pry worked on the login and database.

            Plugins include a "screen shake" effect, a "chromatic aberration" effect, and a plugin that can animate
            any parameter of a video effect based on an oscillator, random number generator, or noise.

        <h3 class="article-subtitle">11 December 2016 - Ongoing</h3>
        <h3 class="article-subtitle">Python, HTML, Sass, JavaScript - Jinja, JSON</h3>
        <p>My website is my oldest still-ongoing project. What makes it unique is that, as a music producer, I want a
            sort of "encyclopedia" of all the songs and albums I have made. I accomplished this with the template engine
            Jinja and a large
            <a href="https://github.com/NitroGuy10/nitroguy10.github.io/blob/master/data/song_data.json">JSON
                file</a> with information about all my songs. Whenever I update the templates or data file, I run a
            Python script to generate all the necessary pages for my website. The stylesheets are done using Sass.
        </p>
        <p>If you're looking for something to read, I've written a <a href="./articles/about_website.html">blog post</a>
            about the process of making this website
            Once again, it is very informal.</p>

        <p>
            ERS-OL (Egyptian Rat Screw Online) is an online multiplayer web game version of my favorite card game,
            Egyptian Rat Screw. Server-client communication is done with Socket.io. Animations are done on the client
            side using the HTML5 canvas.

        <h3 class="article-subtitle">Python</h3>
        <p>
            RoundUp is a command-line tool that copies all files from a directory tree into a single folder. The
            <a href="https://github.com/NitroGuy10/RoundUp#readme">README</a> does a better job of explaining
            this so check it out if you're interested. This was created as a quick solution to automate a process I
            often
            have had to do manually.

        <h3 class="article-subtitle">Python - BeautifulSoup</h3>
        <p>
            tuscon (yes, you read that right) is a super-simple web-templating library. All it
            is is HTML files with parameters, if statements, and
            for loops.

        <h2 class="article-subsection">Pi555</h2>
        <h3 class="article-subtitle">ca. 2016 - 22 December 2019</h3>
        <h3 class="article-subtitle">Java - MIDICSV, Pi4J, Raspberry Pi GPIO</h3>
        <p>
            Pi555 was my first big microcontroller project. It takes in MIDI files as input and plays a song using the
            square wave
            generated from a 555 chip.
            A Java program reads through a MIDI file and translates it into something that the "music player" Java
            program
            can use. This "music player" program, which ran on a Raspberry Pi plays the correct notes at the correct
            times
            on the 555 timer by sending bytes to the digital potentiometer through its GPIO pins.

        <h2 class="article-subsection">Jumpy</h2>

        <h3 class="article-subtitle">17 April 2017 - 4 December 2018</h3>
        <h3 class="article-subtitle">HTML, CSS, JavaScript</h3>
        <p>
            Jumpy is a game I "made" by half following a tutorial and half doing my own thing. I was
            a rather unexperienced but quickly-learning programmer at the time and I remember being so happy when I made
            a nested for-loop that read through the 2D arrays that stored the levels. The game itself is a pretty basic
            HTML5
            canvas web game. It also has a fully-featured level creator.

        <p>
            There's a huge active community dedicated to programming for TI-84 calculators, and I decided to take part
            by making some of my own games.
