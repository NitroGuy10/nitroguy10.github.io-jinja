            Hello! This is a list of some of my programming projects in roughly chronological order.
            This includes software, plugins, webpages, microcontroller projects, et cetera.
            Let me know if you have questions about anything and hope you enjoy!

            When I first started using MAGIX VEGAS Pro 18, I found it generally very advanced and feature
            rich, but at the same time lacking in certain effects that are standard in most editing software
            I've used. When I found out how easy it was to make plugins for VEGAS, I kind of got a little
            obsessed and
            made a whole bunch of 'em! This actually was my first time ever making plugins and
            while there is hardly any information or tutorials online on how to make VEGAS plugins, I must
            say the API and docs- er... <em>doc</em> is quite good. Mostly.

            This was also my first time working with C# outside of Unity and I quite like it. It also helps
            that it was really easy to pick up since its syntax is exceptionally similar to Java except for
            the Capitalization Of Everything. Working with Windows Forms was also very fun. There's
            something I can't really explain about the look of those default Windows dialog boxes that's
            somewhat nostalgic and just generally cool to work with; I get that same feeling with Java's
            Swing using the default look-and-feel. I don't know what it is. Maybe I'm just weird like that.
            I definitely envision myself using C# for something else in the future.

            I guess I should talk about the actual plugins, huh?
