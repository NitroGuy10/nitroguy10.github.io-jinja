            This is an abridged, more formal list of my personal projects including software, plugins, webpages,
            microcontroller projects, et cetera.
            If you would like some personal commentary about each project, visit my main <a
                href="./articles/projects.html">projects article</a>, though please note its tone is much more informal
            and conversational. Let me know if you have questions about anything.
        </p>
        <p>
            Most of these projects are on my <a href="{{ site.nitroguy.socials.github.link }}">GitHub</a>.

        <p>HelpR is a web app where hackathon participants can submit help tickets if they get stuck while making their project.
            The tickets get answered in real-time as mentors at the event will find hackers based on the location they attached to their ticket, and provide the assistance the hackers need.
            It's also a spiritual successor to <a href="https://github.com/ehzhang/HELPq">HELPq</a>.
        </p>
        <p>This might be the largest-scale project I've worked on thus far! It was made in a team 3 for use at TAMUhack hackathons.
            It was first deployed at HowdyHack 2022 on 1-2 October 2022 for use by 200+ hackers, and it worked amazingly with practically no hitches.
        </p>
        <p>I was completely responsible for writing the backend for this app. I created a robust REST API with Express and used a PostgreSQL database to store users and tickets.
            I didn't make the frontend but, in case you were wondering, it's made using React, Next.js, and TailwindCSS.
            This project took months of development but it definitely paid off ...and we're not even done! We are going rewrite the whole thing in TypeScript soon. Wish us luck!

        <p>Compara2r (pronounced "comparator") is a web app which you can use to find out the best thing among a dataset through 1-vs-1 comparisons.
            Users are shown a random comparison and are prompted to vote on which item they think is better.
            Users can vote as many times as they want and can also flag inappropriate items.
            Server admins can download the results and find out once and for all the best ...whatever... of all time.
        </p>
        <p>This was the first time I ever created a full-stack web app from scratch all by myself.
            It was super fun and I learned lot about creating backend servers, using databases, and deployment.
            Speaking of, I actually deployed Compara2r on Heroku using a free dyno which doesn't exist anymore, sadly.

        <p>My website is my oldest still-ongoing project. What makes it unique is that, as a music producer, I want a
            sort of "encyclopedia" of all the songs and albums I have made. I accomplished this with the template engine
            Jinja and a large
            <a href="{{ site.nitroguy.socials.github.link }}/nitroguy10.github.io/blob/master/data/song_data.json">JSON
                file</a> with information about all my songs. Whenever I update the templates or data file, I run a
            Python script to generate all the necessary pages for my website. The stylesheets are done using Sass.
        </p>
        <p>If you're looking for something to read, I've written a <a href="./articles/about_website.html">blog post</a>
            about the process of making this website.
            Once again, it is very informal.</p>

            this so check it out if you're interested. This was created as a quick solution to automate a process I
            often
            have had to do manually.

            tuscon (yes, you read that right) is a super-simple web-templating library. All it

        <h3 class="article-subtitle">Java - MIDICSV, Pi4J, Raspberry Pi GPIO</h3>
        <p>
            Pi555 was my first big microcontroller project. It takes in MIDI files as input and plays a song using the
            square wave
            generated from a 555 chip.
            A Java program reads through a MIDI file and translates it into something that the "music player" Java
            program
            can use. This "music player" program, which runs on a Raspberry Pi, plays the correct notes at the correct
            times
            on the 555 timer by sending bytes to the digital potentiometer through its GPIO pins.

            Jumpy is a game I "made" by half following a tutorial and half doing my own thing. I was
            a rather unexperienced but quickly-learning programmer at the time and I remember being so happy when I made
            a nested for-loop that read through the 2D arrays that stored the levels. The game itself is a pretty basic
            HTML5
            canvas web game. It also has a fully-featured level creator.
