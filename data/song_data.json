I kept trying out different melody ideas and new directions to take the song in, but nothing seemed to fit.

I'll take this time to point out that I made this and Friendship with FL Studio 20 whereas the rest of the FL songs in this list were made with FL 12. For some reason, EWQLSO, the plugin I use for orchestra sounds, had some beef with FL 20 and would never render properly. Because of that, as of the time of writing this, I still use FL 12.
